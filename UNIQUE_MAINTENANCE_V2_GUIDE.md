# 🔧 Unique Item Maintenance V2 - Streamlined System

## 🎯 **REVOLUTIONARY SIMPLIFICATION**

The unique item maintenance system has been **completely streamlined** by leveraging our comprehensive stat tracking system!

---

## 🔥 **HOW IT WORKS NOW**

### **Old System** ❌
- Tracked activity separately in each unique item
- Duplicated stat tracking across systems
- Complex activity tracking logic
- Limited maintenance types

### **New System V2** ✅
- **Uses comprehensive stat tracking** as the source of truth
- **Stores only previous values** for comparison
- **Simple delta calculation**: `current_stat - last_maintenance_stat`
- **Unlimited maintenance variety** using any tracked stat

---

## 📊 **MAINTENANCE TYPES NOW AVAILABLE**

### **Basic Types** (existing)
- ✅ **Coins** - Pay money for maintenance
- ✅ **Wealthiest** - Must remain richest player

### **Mining-Based** (enhanced)
- ✅ **Mining Activity** - Walls broken since last maintenance
- ✅ **Movement Activity** - Tiles travelled since last maintenance  
- ✅ **Ore Mining** - Specific ore types mined since last maintenance
- ✅ **Wall Breaking** - Total walls broken since last maintenance
- ✅ **Power Level** - Must reach specific power level
- ✅ **Break Participation** - Mining breaks participated since last maintenance

### **Innkeeping-Based** (new)
- ✅ **Innkeeping Activity** - Coins earned from inn since last maintenance
- ✅ **Customer Service** - Customers served since last maintenance

### **Market-Based** (new)
- ✅ **Market Activity** - Revenue generated since last maintenance

### **Discord-Based** (enhanced)
- ✅ **Voice Activity** - Voice time since last maintenance

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **How Maintenance Works**
1. **Store Previous Value** - When maintenance succeeds, store current stat value
2. **Calculate Delta** - Next maintenance checks: `current_stat - stored_value`
3. **Check Requirement** - If delta ≥ requirement, maintenance succeeds
4. **Update Stored Value** - Store new current value for next cycle

### **Example: Ore-Specific Maintenance**
```javascript
// Item requires 50 Iron Ore since last maintenance
const currentIronOre = 150; // From comprehensive stats
const lastIronOre = 75;     // Stored from last maintenance
const delta = 150 - 75 = 75; // Mined since last maintenance

if (delta >= 50) {
    // Maintenance succeeds!
    // Store new value: lastIronOre = 150
}
```

### **Benefits**
- ✅ **No Duplicate Tracking** - Uses existing comprehensive stats
- ✅ **Accurate Progress** - Based on actual game activity
- ✅ **Unlimited Variety** - Can use any tracked stat for maintenance
- ✅ **Simple Logic** - Just compare current vs stored values

## 🎮 **NEW MAINTENANCE POSSIBILITIES**

With comprehensive stat tracking, we can now create maintenance based on:

### **Detailed Mining Stats**
- Specific ore types (Iron Ore, Gold Ore, Shadow Ore, etc.)
- Rare ore discoveries
- Map expansions
- Familiar activity
- Gullet item consumption

### **Innkeeping Stats**
- Customer happiness ratios
- Inn expansions
- Employee management
- Profit margins

### **Market Stats**
- Trading volume
- Customer relationships
- NPC shop interactions

### **Combined Requirements**
- Multi-stat requirements (e.g., mine 100 ores AND serve 50 customers)
- Progressive requirements (increasing with each maintenance)
- Seasonal requirements (different stats per time period)
