# Mining Special Events - Fixes Applied & Debug Guide

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Special Event Ending Issue - FIXED**
The main problem was that special events (like the thief game) weren't ending properly because the check was only happening once, not periodically.

#### What was wrong:
- Events were set to end after 10 minutes
- But the check only ran when the main mining loop executed (which doesn't run during breaks)
- The setTimeout that opened the shop didn't actually end the special event

#### What was fixed:
- Added `setInterval` to check every 30 seconds during long breaks
- Added event ending check before break ends
- Enhanced logging to track event lifecycle
- Fixed timing consistency issues

### 2. **Files Modified**
- `mining_optimized_v5_performance.js` - Main mining logic
- `miningEvents.js` - Event handling and debug functions

## 🎮 New Debug Commands

### `/testminingevent` - Test Special Events
Debug and control special events in mining sessions.

**Subcommands:**
- **`status`** - Check current special event status
  - Shows active event type, time remaining, thief info
  - Shows break status and timing
  
- **`forceend`** - Force end the current special event
  - Immediately ends any active event
  - Useful for testing event cleanup
  
- **`startthief`** - Force start a thief event
  - Requires at least 2 players in voice channel
  - Starts a thief event immediately
  
- **`breakinfo`** - Get detailed break and event information
  - Shows complete session debug info
  - Includes stats, minecart info, timing

### `/miningdebug` - Mining System Control
Advanced control over the mining system.

**Subcommands:**
- **`forcebreak`** - Force start a break period
  - Choose between short (5 min) or long (25 min) break
  - Immediately starts the selected break type
  
- **`endbreak`** - Force end the current break
  - Immediately ends break and resumes mining
  
- **`resetcycle`** - Reset the mining cycle counter
  - Resets to cycle 0
  - Next long break will be on cycle 3
  
- **`clearmap`** - Clear and regenerate the mining map
  - Deletes current map
  - New map generates on next tick
  
- **`sessioninfo`** - Get complete mining session information
  - Comprehensive session data
  - Map info, stats, timing, events

## 📊 How Special Events Work Now

### Event Lifecycle:
1. **Long Break Starts** (every 4th cycle)
   - Break duration: 25 minutes
   - Event duration: 10 minutes
   - Shop opens after event ends

2. **Event Selection**
   - Picks random event based on player count
   - Currently: Thief Game or Mine Collapse

3. **Event Monitoring** (NEW)
   - Checks every 30 seconds if event should end
   - Properly cleans up when time expires
   - Opens shop after event concludes

4. **Event Ending**
   - Announces results (thief caught/escaped)
   - Distributes rewards
   - Clears event data
   - Opens shop for remaining break time

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### To Test Event Ending:
1. Join a voice channel with mining active
2. Use `/testminingevent status` to check current state
3. Wait for or force a long break
4. Use `/testminingevent startthief` to start event
5. Monitor console logs for periodic checks
6. Event should end after 10 minutes automatically
7. Use `/testminingevent status` to verify it ended

### To Debug Issues:
1. **Check Console Logs**
   - Look for `[checkAndEndSpecialEvent]` messages
   - These show when events are being checked

2. **Use Status Commands**
   - `/testminingevent status` - Quick event check
   - `/testminingevent breakinfo` - Detailed info
   - `/miningdebug sessioninfo` - Complete data

3. **Force Test Scenarios**
   - Start event: `/testminingevent startthief`
   - End event: `/testminingevent forceend`
   - Start break: `/miningdebug forcebreak long`

## 🔍 Console Log Messages

You'll see these in your console when events are working:

```
[checkAndEndSpecialEvent] Checking for channel 123456789
[checkAndEndSpecialEvent] Event type: thief
[checkAndEndSpecialEvent] Event end time: 1234567890
[checkAndEndSpecialEvent] Should end? true
[checkAndEndSpecialEvent] Ending thief game...
[checkAndEndSpecialEvent] Event ended successfully
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Thief Game** requires at least 2 players
2. **Mine Collapse** works with any player count
3. Events only trigger during long breaks (every 4th cycle)
4. Shop opens 10 minutes into a 25-minute long break

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

```bash
# 1. Start your bot
node index.js

# 2. Join a voice channel with mining

# 3. Force a long break
/miningdebug forcebreak type:long

# 4. Start a thief event
/testminingevent startthief

# 5. Check status
/testminingevent status

# 6. Watch console for periodic checks every 30 seconds

# 7. Event should end after 10 minutes
```

## 📝 Troubleshooting

### Event Not Ending?
1. Check console for error messages
2. Use `/testminingevent status` to see if event exists
3. Check if break is still active
4. Use `/testminingevent forceend` as last resort

### Event Not Starting?
1. Ensure you're in a long break (not short)
2. Check player count (thief needs 2+ players)
3. Clear any existing event first
4. Check console for error messages

### Shop Not Opening After Event?
1. Event should end after 10 minutes
2. Shop opens automatically after event ends
3. Check if still in break period
4. Manually open with `/generateshop` if needed

## 🔧 Important: Register New Commands

After adding the new debug commands, you need to register them with Discord:

```bash
# Run your register commands script
node registerCommands.js
```

This will register:
- `/testminingevent` - Special event debugging
- `/miningdebug` - Mining system control
- `/shoptest` - Shop performance testing (from earlier)

The commands should appear in Discord after a few minutes.

## Summary

The special event system is now properly fixed with:
- ✅ Periodic checking every 30 seconds
- ✅ Proper event cleanup
- ✅ Enhanced logging
- ✅ Debug commands for testing
- ✅ Comprehensive status tracking

Your events should now end reliably after their set duration!
