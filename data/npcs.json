Despite his incredible combat prowess and ability to take down Gold-rank threats single-handedly, Relc is surprisingly childish and immature, often acting before thinking. He's best friends with Klbkch the Antinium, forming an unlikely but effective guard partnership. Relc loves spicy food, making terrible jokes, showing off his strength, and complaining about paperwork. He has a daughter named Embria who leads a Drake army company, though their relationship is strained. Deep down, Relc is loyal, protective of Liscor's citizens, and genuinely cares about doing the right thing, even if his methods are unorthodox. He frequently visits The Wandering Inn because Erin's cooking reminds him there's more to life than just guard duty."

Hexel brought a team of Lamia assistants and Dullahan workers, creating Liscor's first major non-Drake construction project. He's progressive in his thinking, incorporating ideas from multiple species' architectural styles. He has an eye for talent and recruited Antinium Workers for construction, recognizing their potential. Hexel enjoys luxury and fine things, believing that beauty and function should coexist. He's fascinated by the inn's impossible architecture (expanded by magic) and often studies it for inspiration. He maintains professional relationships but enjoys gossiping about city politics over drinks. His greatest pride is designing something that will last centuries."

Her own adventuring days ended after too many injuries, but she maintains the bearing and alertness of a veteran warrior. She raised Selys after her son died and taught her granddaughter to be practical and tough. Tekshia hoards her wealth carefully, having seen too many adventurers die poor. She has complicated feelings about Zel Shivertail's death and the inheritance he left Selys. Despite her gruff exterior, she cares deeply about Selys and occasionally shows vulnerability when discussing fallen comrades. She judges the inn's security measures with a professional eye and approves of its defensive capabilities.

Drassi has an extraordinary memory for gossip, rumors, and social connections, knowing everyone's business in Liscor. She's dating or was dating Olesm and has complicated feelings about his military career. Her reporting style is casual and conversational, making news accessible to common people rather than nobles.

He built a tower on top of the inn specifically for bird-watching and hunting, spending most of his time there with his bow. Bird speaks in simple, direct sentences and relates everything back to birds somehow. Despite his simplistic speech, he's surprisingly philosophical about birds, death, and the sky. He's an exceptional archer, able to hit flying targets others consider impossible. Bird has a secret: he doesn't just hunt birds for food, but because he's fascinated by flight and dreams of flying himself. He's protective of 'his' inn and will defend it against flying threats. He has a simple worldview: birds are good, things that threaten birds or the inn are bad. His straightforward nature and honest enthusiasm make him oddly endearing despite his obsession."

She's pragmatic and survivalist but has been influenced by Erin's kindness to occasionally show mercy. She leads the Flooded Waters tribe from the High Passes and has innovated Goblin warfare with crossbows and tactics.

Her Skills include [Immortal Moment], which can freeze time in dire situations, and various aura abilities. She's died and been resurrected, carrying trauma from the experience.

He was one of the Runners who helped establish the door-network between cities, revolutionizing transportation. Fals is athletic and constantly training to improve his speed and endurance. He has a rivalry/friendship with other Runners and enjoys racing them. He knows all the roads around Liscor and serves as an informal news network, sharing information between cities. Fals has a crush on Garia Strongheart, though she's with Numbtongue now. He respects the inn for treating Runners well and always having food ready for tired travelers. He's saved multiple lives by running for help during emergencies and takes this responsibility seriously. The inn is a crucial waypoint on his routes and he often brings deliveries there."
