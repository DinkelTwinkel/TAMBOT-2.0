# Pickaxe Durability PlayerTag Fix

## The Problem
The `PlayerInventory` model requires a `playerTag` field, but it wasn't being properly set when updating inventory during pickaxe breaking, causing a validation error:

```
PlayerInventory validation failed: playerTag: Path `playerTag` is required.
```

## The Solution

### 1. Updated `improvedDurabilityHandling.js`
Added code to ensure `playerTag` is set on the inventory before saving:

```javascript
// Ensure playerTag is set if missing
if (!inventory.playerTag && playerTag) {
    inventory.playerTag = playerTag;
}
```

This is added in two places:
- When the pickaxe breaks (quantity reduction or removal)
- When durability is updated without breaking

### 2. Updated test file
Modified `test_pickaxe_durability.js` to include `playerTag` when creating test inventories:

```javascript
await PlayerInventory.findOneAndUpdate(
    { playerId: testPlayerId },
    {
        $set: {
            playerId: testPlayerId,
            playerTag: testPlayerTag,  // Added this line
            items: [...]
        }
    }
);
```

### 3. Updated implementation guide
In `FINAL_PICKAXE_FIX.js`, added proper playerTag handling for voice channel members:

```javascript
// NOTE: Voice channel members don't have user.tag, so we create a tag format
const playerTag = member.user?.tag || `${member.displayName}#0000`;
```

## Why This Happened
Voice channel members in Discord.js don't always have the `user.tag` property accessible, especially in voice-based events. The mining system operates in voice channels, so we need to handle this case by creating a pseudo-tag format using the display name.

## Testing
Run the test to verify everything works:
```bash
node patterns/gachaModes/test_pickaxe_durability.js
```

The test should now complete successfully without validation errors.

## Important Notes
- Always pass a `playerTag` when calling `handlePickaxeDurability`
- For voice channel members, use: `member.user?.tag || \`${member.displayName}#0000\``
- The inventory model requires `playerTag` as a non-null field
- The fix ensures backward compatibility by only setting `playerTag` if it's missing
