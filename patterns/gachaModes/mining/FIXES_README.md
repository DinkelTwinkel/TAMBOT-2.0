# Mining System Fixes - Tent Display & Long Break Cycles

## Issues Fixed

### 3. Multiple Pickaxe Breaking Issue (NEW)
**Problem**: Players losing 20+ pickaxes in a single break event.
**Cause**: `handlePickaxeDurability` being called multiple times for the same mining action (main mining, area damage, chain mining, special effects).
**Solution**:
- Created `durabilityManager.js` for centralized durability tracking
- Added `pickaxe_hotfix.js` as immediate fix with 2-second cooldown
- Prevents duplicate durability checks within same tick
- Area damage no longer triggers additional durability loss

### 1. Tent Display Issue
**Problem**: Players were still being rendered as tents after short breaks ended.
**Cause**: The `isTent` flag in player positions wasn't being properly cleared when breaks ended.
**Solution**: 
- Added `clearTentFlags()` function to explicitly clear all tent flags
- Modified `endBreak()` to use this function
- Added verification step to double-check flags are cleared
- Added emergency cleanup in error handlers

### 2. Long Break Cycle Issue
**Problem**: Long breaks were repeating or not following the correct pattern (3 short, 1 long).
**Cause**: The `cycleCount` field was not being initialized or properly incremented.
**Solution**:
- Added `cycleCount` initialization to `initializeGameData()`
- Added verification logging when incrementing cycles
- Added pattern checking to ensure correct break type

## Files Modified

1. **mining_optimized_v5_performance.js**
   - Added imports for fix modules
   - Modified `endBreak()` function
   - Added tent flag verification
   - Enhanced cycle counting logging

2. **miningDatabase.js**
   - Added `cycleCount` initialization in `initializeGameData()`
   - Ensures field exists for all channels

## New Files Created

   - Detailed instructions for applying the full fix
   - Code examples and replacement patterns
   - Integration guide for durabilityManager

8. **PICKAXE_FIX_README.md**
   - Complete documentation of the pickaxe issue
   - Multiple solution options (hotfix vs full fix)
   - Testing procedures

1. **fix_tent_display.js**
   - `clearTentFlags()` - Removes all tent flags from positions
   - `verifyAndFixPlayerPositions()` - Checks and fixes stale flags
   - `scatterPlayersForBreakFixed()` - Improved scatter function

2. **fix_long_break_cycle.js**
   - `initializeCycleCount()` - Ensures cycle count exists
   - `verifyCycleCount()` - Logs and verifies cycle patterns
   - `fixStuckCycleCount()` - Fixes stuck cycles
   - `debugAllCycles()` - Debug report for all channels

3. **immediate_tent_hotfix.js**
   - Script to immediately fix stuck tent displays
   - Can be run manually: `node immediate_tent_hotfix.js`

4. **debug_and_fix_cycles.js**
   - Comprehensive debugging tool for cycle issues
   - Run: `node debug_and_fix_cycles.js` to see report
   - Run: `node debug_and_fix_cycles.js --fix` to auto-fix issues

## How the Cycle System Works

The break cycle follows this pattern:
- Cycle 0: SHORT BREAK (0 % 4 = 0)
- Cycle 1: SHORT BREAK (1 % 4 = 1)
- Cycle 2: SHORT BREAK (2 % 4 = 2)
- Cycle 3: LONG BREAK (3 % 4 = 3)
- Cycle 4: SHORT BREAK (4 % 4 = 0) - pattern repeats

Each cycle represents one complete mining session + break.

## Debugging Commands

### Check Current Status
```javascript
// In your bot console or eval command:
const { debugAllChannels } = require('./patterns/gachaModes/mining/debug_and_fix_cycles');
await debugAllChannels();
```

### Fix Specific Channel
```javascript
const { fixChannel } = require('./patterns/gachaModes/mining/debug_and_fix_cycles');
await fixChannel('CHANNEL_ID');
```

### Fix Tent Display
```javascript
const { fixSpecificChannel } = require('./patterns/gachaModes/mining/immediate_tent_hotfix');
await fixSpecificChannel('CHANNEL_ID');
```

### Reset Channel Cycle
```javascript
const { resetChannelCycle } = require('./patterns/gachaModes/mining/debug_and_fix_cycles');
await resetChannelCycle('CHANNEL_ID');
```

## Monitoring

The system now logs detailed information about cycles:
- `[CYCLE TRACKING]` - Shows cycle increments and patterns
- `[BREAK START]` - Shows what type of break is starting
- `[TENT FIX]` - Shows when tent flags are cleared
- `[CYCLE FIX]` - Shows when cycle issues are fixed

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Players losing multiple pickaxes at once
**Solution**: 
- Quick: Change import to use `pickaxe_hotfix.js`
- Proper: Implement `durabilityManager.js` as per patch file

### Issue: "Lost 20 pickaxes" complaints
**Check**: Look for multiple `[DURABILITY]` logs in quick succession
**Solution**: Apply hotfix immediately, then implement full fix

### Issue: Long breaks keep repeating
**Solution**: Run `node debug_and_fix_cycles.js --fix`

### Issue: Players stuck as tents
**Solution**: Run `node immediate_tent_hotfix.js`

### Issue: Break never ends
**Check**: Look for `[HOTFIX] Clearing expired break` in logs
**Solution**: The system should auto-fix this, but you can force it with `fixChannel()`

### Issue: Wrong break type
**Check**: Verify cycle count with `debugAllChannels()`
**Solution**: May need to reset cycle with `resetChannelCycle()`

## Prevention

The system now includes several preventive measures:
1. **Automatic initialization** - Missing fields are auto-created
2. **Expired break detection** - Breaks that should have ended are auto-cleared
3. **Tent flag verification** - Checks and clears stale flags each cycle
4. **Cycle verification** - Logs pattern to ensure correct progression
5. **Emergency cleanup** - Error handlers clear states properly

## Testing

After applying fixes:
1. Run `node debug_and_fix_cycles.js` to check all channels
2. Monitor a full cycle (25 min mining + 5 min break)
3. Verify cycle increments: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 (long) → 4 → 5...
4. Check that tents only appear during breaks
5. Verify long breaks occur every 4th cycle

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:
- Automatic cycle validation on each mining tick
- Break history tracking for debugging
- Cycle reset command for admins
- Visual indicator of current cycle in mining map
- Automatic recovery for corrupted cycle data
