## When to Use Reset

### Recommended Use Cases:
‚úÖ **Channel is stuck in break** - Break timer expired but still showing as in break
‚úÖ **Map corruption** - Players can't move or map doesn't render
‚úÖ **Testing/Development** - Need a clean slate for testing
‚úÖ **Major bugs** - Game is unplayable due to corrupted data
‚úÖ **Server migration** - Moving to new server/shard

### NOT Recommended:
‚ùå **Players want to restart** - They'll lose all progress
‚ùå **Minor bugs** - Try specific fixes first
‚ùå **Active mining session** - Will kick all players

---

## Safety Features

1. **Confirmation Required** - Discord command requires explicit confirmation
2. **Backup Info Displayed** - Shows current data before deletion
3. **Admin Only** - Discord command restricted to administrators
4. **Countdown Timer** - Batch operations have cancel window
5. **Detailed Logging** - All operations logged for debugging

---

## Troubleshooting

### Reset failed with "Instance locked"
Another process is using the channel. Wait a moment and try again.

### "No entry to delete"
Channel has no mining data. This is normal for unused channels.

### Warnings during reset
Non-critical warnings are normal. The reset will still complete.

### Players still see old data
Players may need to:
1. Leave and rejoin the voice channel
2. Wait for next update cycle (usually within 1 minute)
3. Use `/miningfix` command if available

---

## Emergency Reset

If normal reset fails, use this nuclear option:

```javascript
// In MongoDB shell or Compass
db.gachavcs.deleteOne({ channelId: "CHANNEL_ID_HERE" })
```

Then restart the bot to clear all caches.

---

## Development Notes

### Adding New Reset Steps

To add new systems to the reset process, edit `resetMiningData.js`:

```javascript
// Add your reset step
console.log('\nüîß Clearing new system...');
try {
    await yourSystem.clear(channelId);
    results.success.push('New system cleared');
    console.log('   ‚úÖ Done');
} catch (error) {
    results.warnings.push(`New system: ${error.message}`);
    console.log('   ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:', error.message);
}
```

### Testing Resets

Always test resets on a development channel first:
```bash
node patterns/quickResetMining.js test --dry-run
```

## Support

For issues or questions about the reset utilities:
1. Check the console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify MongoDB connection is working
3. Ensure you have proper permissions
4. Check that the channel ID is correct

Remember: **Resets are permanent!** Always backup important data before resetting production channels.
