/**
 * PROFIT DISTRIBUTION EXAMPLE
 * 
 * Scenario: 4 members in the voice channel (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana)
 * Sales in the last 10 minutes:
 * 
 * Sale 1: Alice buys Sword for 100 coins (profit: 50 coins)
 *   - Distribution: Bob, Charlie, Diana each get 16 coins (50/3 = 16.66, rounded down)
 * 
 * Sale 2: Bob buys Potion for 30 coins (profit: 15 coins)
 *   - Distribution: Alice, Charlie, Diana each get 5 coins (15/3 = 5)
 * 
 * Sale 3: External user buys Shield for 200 coins (profit: 100 coins)
 *   - Distribution: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana each get 25 coins (100/4 = 25)
 * 
 * FINAL EARNINGS:
 * - Alice: 5 + 25 = 30 coins (didn't get profit from her own purchase)
 * - Bob: 16 + 25 = 41 coins (didn't get profit from his own purchase)
 * - Charlie: 16 + 5 + 25 = 46 coins
 * - Diana: 16 + 5 + 25 = 46 coins
 * 
 * Total distributed: 163 coins (some coins lost to rounding)
