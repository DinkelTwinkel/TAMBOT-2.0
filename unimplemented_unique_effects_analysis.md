## Recommendation

The mining system has a solid foundation with basic unique item bonuses, but many advanced features described in the unique items are not implemented. Consider implementing these systems in order of priority:

1. **High Priority**: Ore value multipliers, health system, team buffs
2. **Medium Priority**: Visual effects, advanced clone system, hazard-specific immunity
3. **Low Priority**: NPC system, title system, machinery system
